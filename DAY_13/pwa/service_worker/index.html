        One Piece is one of the most daunting anime one could start watching. It
        began when mangaka, Eiichiro Oda, started publishing One Piece in Weekly
        Shonen Jump’s manga magazine in 1997. It would get a quick anime
        adaption that started airing in 1999, and it became known as one of
        Shonen Jump’s “Big Three,” the most popular titles in the magazine,
        alongside Bleach and Naruto. Roughly a decade after the term the Big
        Three was coined, One Piece is the only manga and anime still running
        with weekly manga chapters and anime episodes.
