        One Piece really went all out with the action scenes in Episode 1017 of
        the anime, so now is the time to check it out! As a whole, fans have
        noticed a huge shift behind the scenes when Dragon Ball Super: Broly
        director Tatsuya Nagamine took over as the main one steering the shift
        for the Wano Country arc. This has not only resulted in some of the best
        scenes in the series to date, but many episodes fans are now considering
        the best in the anime's run overall. As it continues beyond the 1000th
        episode mark, it's clear there are no signs of slowing down.
